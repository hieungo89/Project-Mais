## App Features

### Product Overview:

<div align="center">
  <img width="500" alt="Product Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7556bee9-8127-41ce-a941-e640cef9e465">
</div>
The overview section features an image gallery accompanied by a sidebar containing product information, style selectors, and add-to-cart functionality. When a different style is chosen, the image gallery updates accordingly. Similarly, selecting a new product triggers the sidebar to update. Users can specify the style, size, and quantity of the product before adding it to their cart. For discounted items, the original price is shown with a strikethrough, alongside the new discounted price.

</div>
Users can browse the related products carousel to discover suggested items. Each card within the carousel displays the product's name, image, price, and rating. Users have the option to add the current product to their outfit list, which remains intact even after refreshing the browser. Selecting a related product will reload the page to display the chosen item.

</div>
This section showcases questions and answers related to the product. By default, only two sets are displayed, but users can click to expand and view more. Users have the ability to post their own questions and answers, mark specific entries as helpful, and report inappropriate content. Marking as helpful elevates the entry to the top of the list, making it easier for others to find valuable information. Additionally, a search bar is provided for users to find specific questions or answers quickly.
